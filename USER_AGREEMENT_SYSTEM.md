# User Agreement & Privacy (Consent System)

Vetale Browser shows a **User Agreement** on first launch (or after a reset) to explain how browsing works and what data may be processed.

This document explains the consent flow in simple terms.

---

## What happens on first launch

- Vetale Browser shows the **User Agreement** window.
- You must confirm you’ve read it and click **Accept & Continue** to use the browser.
- If you don’t accept, the app closes.

## You can view it later

You can open the agreement anytime:

1. Click **Tools** (🛠️)
2. Select **User Agreement** (🛡️)

## What data is stored locally (on your PC)

Vetale Browser is designed to store most browser data **locally**. Examples include:
- settings and preferences
- history, bookmarks, and sessions
- tool logs (Console / DevTools)
- download history/metadata
- API keys (stored locally and encrypted)

Websites you visit can still store their own data (for example, cookies) inside the web engine, like in any browser.

## What may be sent to the internet

When you use online services, some information must be sent to those services to work.

Examples:
- **Web browsing:** when you open a website, your device connects to that site.
- **Search providers:** if you use an online search engine, your query is sent to that provider.
- **AI features:** if you use an AI provider that runs online, your messages are sent to that provider.
- **Voice input:** if a voice recognition feature is enabled and uses an online engine, audio may be processed by that engine.

The exact services used depend on what you enable and which providers you choose.

## Your control (practical)

You can control your data by:
- clearing browsing data (history, cookies, cache) using the browser UI
- disabling features you don’t want to use (AI, voice, online integrations)
- removing API keys to prevent external integrations from working

If you stop using a specific online provider, the browser will stop sending new data to it.

---

## Notes and limitations

- Vetale Browser can’t control how third‑party websites and providers handle data on their side.
- Always review the privacy policy of any external service you enable.

---

## Technical note (for transparency)

The acceptance status is stored in the local settings database so the agreement isn’t shown again on every launch.
