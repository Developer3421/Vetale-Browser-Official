# Appearance Customization (Overview)

Vetale Browser lets you customize the UI so it matches your workflow (compact, readable, high contrast, etc.).

You can adjust things like:
- tab sizes and tab colors
- address/navigation bar size and colors
- window sizes
- colors for other windows (settings/tools/history, etc.)

## Open Appearance settings

1. Open **Vetale Browser**
2. Go to **Tools → Settings**
3. Select **Appearance**

Inside Appearance you’ll see separate sections for:
- **Tabs**
- **Main Window**
- **Other Windows**

---

## How saving works

- Change values in the fields.
- Click **Save settings** at the bottom of the page.
- Some changes may require closing and reopening the window to fully apply.

## Reset to defaults

Each Appearance page includes a **Reset to default** button.

Use it if:
- you made the UI too small/large
- colors became hard to read
- something looks “broken” after experiments

## Tips for good results

- **Contrast matters:** use light text on dark backgrounds or dark text on light backgrounds.
- **Go step-by-step:** adjust one group (Tabs) first, then Main Window.
- **Keep it readable:** extremely small font sizes can make tabs and buttons hard to use.
