Key points:

- Websites you visit may set cookies and collect data according to their own policies.
- If you enable AI / voice features, your content may be processed by the configured engine/provider:
  - **Local AI** runs on your device when available/configured.
  - **Voice recognition** requires microphone permission and uses the project’s Whisper pipeline.
