## Open Appearance settings

1. Open **Vetale Browser**
2. Go to **Tools → Settings**
3. Choose **Appearance**

You’ll see three sections:
- **Tabs**
- **Main Window**
- **Other Windows**

---

## Tabs

Use this section to control how your tabs look and how much information fits on screen.

Typical options include:
- **Tab width** (in pixels)
- **Tab text size**
- **Tab icon size** (favicon)
- **Tab background color** (inactive)
- **Tab text color**
- **Active tab color**

Suggested ranges:
- Tab width: **160–320 px**
- Text size: **12–20 px**

## Main Window

This section affects the main browser window (navigation bar, window size, and button sizing).

Typical options include:
- **Navigation bar color**
- **Navigation bar height** (in pixels)
- **Default window width / height**
- **Top line / frame color**
- **Button size**
- **Button icon size**

Suggested ranges:
- Navigation bar height: **35–50 px**
- Button size: **28–40 px**
- Button icon size: **14–24 px**

---

## Other Windows

This section controls the look of secondary windows (for example: Tools, Settings, History).

Typical options include:
- **Window background color**
- **Top bar color**

---

## Color format (HEX)

Colors are entered in **HEX** format:
- Format: `#RRGGBB`
- Examples:
  - White: `#FFFFFF`
  - Black: `#000000`
  - Red: `#FF0000`
  - Green: `#00FF00`
  - Blue: `#0000FF`

Tip: if the UI becomes hard to read, increase contrast (dark text on light background, or light text on dark background).

## Save changes

1. Enter your values
2. Click **Save settings** at the bottom

Notes:
- Settings are stored locally on your PC.
- Some changes may require you to close and reopen the affected window.

---

## Reset to defaults

Each Appearance page provides a **Reset to default** button.

This resets the current page only (for example, only Tabs).

Use it if:
- you want to undo experiments quickly
- the UI becomes uncomfortable to use

---

## Troubleshooting

### My colors don’t apply
- Make sure the value starts with `#` and has exactly **6 hex digits**.
- Click **Save settings**.
- Close and reopen the window.

### The UI became too large / too small
- Use **Reset to default** on the page you changed.
- Then adjust again using the suggested ranges above.
